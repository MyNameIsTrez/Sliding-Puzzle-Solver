# Sliding-Puzzle-Solver

`python main.py`

After 10,954,175 states, which is a path length of 117 the program stops.

I'm not sure why the program doesn't find the solution with path length 81 which should be the shortest one, [according to Klotski's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klotski).
